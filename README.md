Title: Intelligent Home Surveillance System using Python

Description:

Enhance the security of your home with our Intelligent Home Surveillance System, a Python-powered project designed to provide advanced monitoring and alert capabilities. This comprehensive solution incorporates cutting-edge technologies to offer motion detection, recorded video storage, and a robust alarm system, ensuring peace of mind for homeowners.

Key Features:

Motion Detection:

The system employs sophisticated motion detection algorithms using OpenCV, enabling it to discern changes in the environment. As soon as motion is detected, the system triggers recording and alerts, enhancing the ability to capture potentially suspicious activities.

Recorded Videos:

Capture high-quality videos of detected motion events. The project utilizes video recording functionality to store footage securely, ensuring that users can review and analyze past events easily. This feature proves invaluable for monitoring, forensics, and peace of mind.

Alarm System:

An integrated alarm system provides an additional layer of security. When motion is detected, the system can activate alarms through various channels, such as sound alerts, email notifications, or even push notifications to a dedicated mobile app. Users can customize the alarm settings based on their preferences.
